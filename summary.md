# Summary of Progress

I've successfully implemented the restaurant layout feature with complete drag-and-drop functionality! Here's what's complete:

## ✅ Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (Complete)

Created 2 new hooks:

- `useUnassignedTables.ts` - Fetches tables not assigned to any slot
- `useAssignedTables.ts` - Fetches tables currently in slots

Enhanced `useLayoutMutations.ts` with 6 mutations:

- `assignTableToSlot` - Assign a table to a slot
- `unassignTable` - Remove table from slot
- `deleteSlot` - Delete entire slot
- `swapTables` - Swap two tables between slots
- `updateLayout` - Update slot position
- `createSlot` - Create new empty slots

## ✅ Phase 2: UI Components (Complete)

Created 4 new components:

- `CollapsibleSection.tsx` - Reusable collapsible section with chevron icons
- `DraggableTableItem.tsx` - Individual table card in sidebar (drag-enabled)
- `LayoutSidebar.tsx` - Right sidebar with two collapsible sections
- `SlotActionModal.tsx` - Modal for slot actions (removed in favor of direct buttons)

Enhanced `LayoutSlot.tsx`:

- Color coding: Empty=gray, Occupied=green, Linked=blue
- Lock/unlock button with visual feedback
- Direct action buttons: Unassign, Delete
- Shows table name, capacity, and link indicator
- Drop zone detection with visual highlights

Updated `RestaurantLayout.tsx`:

- Click-to-create slot functionality
- Full drag-and-drop integration
- Responsive layout with mobile support
- Enhanced loading states and error handling

## ✅ Phase 3: Drag & Drop Logic (Complete)

Implemented complete drag-and-drop system:

- **Drop zone detection**: Slot-to-slot, sidebar-to-slot, slot-to-sidebar
- **Visual feedback**:
  - Dragging items become semi-transparent
  - Drop zones highlight in blue with ring effect
  - Smooth transitions and animations
- **Table swap logic**: Automatically swaps tables when dragging to occupied slots
- **Lock state**: Prevents all operations when slot is locked
- **Smart handling**:
  - Assign from sidebar to empty slot
  - Swap between occupied slots
  - Unassign by dragging back to sidebar
  - Move between empty slots

## ✅ Phase 4: Visual Enhancements (Complete)

Polish and user experience improvements:

- **Color coding**:
  - Gray: Empty slots
  - Green: Occupied slots
  - Blue: Linked tables
- **Table information display**:
  - Table name and capacity
  - Slot number
  - Link icon for linked tables
- **Responsive design**:
  - Sidebar hidden on mobile (< md breakpoint)
  - Responsive padding adjustments
  - Maintains aspect ratio across screen sizes
- **Loading states**:
  - Animated spinner for layout
  - Skeleton loaders for sidebar
  - Proper error messages with details
- **Visual polish**:
  - Hover effects on slots
  - Shadow and ring effects
  - Smooth transitions

## 📋 Key Features Implemented

### For Yaoyao (Admin)

✅ Create slots by clicking on layout
✅ Drag tables from sidebar to assign to slots
✅ Drag between slots to swap tables
✅ Drag back to sidebar to unassign
✅ Lock/unlock slots to prevent changes
✅ Delete slots with confirmation
✅ Visual indication of linked tables

### Technical Improvements

✅ API endpoint simplified to single GET /layouts
✅ Client-side filtering for better performance
✅ Zone field added for multi-floor support
✅ Validation schema updated for slot creation
✅ Repository functions for swap operations
✅ Type-safe with proper TypeScript types
✅ Optimistic UI updates via React Query

## 🎯 What's Working

1. **Slot Creation**: Click anywhere on layout to create new empty slots
2. **Table Assignment**: Drag unassigned tables to empty slots
3. **Table Swapping**: Drag between occupied slots to swap
4. **Table Unassignment**: Drag from slot back to sidebar
5. **Visual Feedback**: All drag operations show clear visual indicators
6. **Lock System**: Locked slots reject all modifications
7. **Linked Tables**: Blue color and icon for tables with links
8. **Responsive**: Works on all screen sizes

## 📝 Important Notes

### Schema & API

- Added `zone` field to Layout model for multi-floor support
- Lock state is client-side only (not persisted in DB)
- Single GET /layouts endpoint with client-side filtering
- Swap endpoint for atomic table swapping

### No Conflicts

- `/layout` page has LayoutSidebar (right panel)
- `/dashboard/*` has DashboardSidebar (left nav)
- Both work independently without conflicts

## � Next Steps (Future Enhancements)

The core functionality is complete! Possible future improvements:

- Add zone selector to switch between floors
- Bulk slot creation tools
- Undo/redo functionality
- Keyboard shortcuts for power users
- Export/import layout configurations
- Table filtering in sidebar
- Search functionality for tables
