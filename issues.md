1. The mobile navigation for the sideNav in #dashboard does not support swiping to open the sidebar again, once it hides there's no way to open it back. It is broken

2. The translation keys for staging management is missing in all languages.

3. The color for the staging card too bright it hurts your eyes, keep it simple and no gradient just like the standard in other pages like tables/tabelsDetails/FoodCard etc

4. The food management list needs its pagination controller and needs mobile support.

5. The API is broken in table management, but this can be removed as we're now into the staging. maybe make a toggle to switch between the staging and the production editing in dashboard/table

6. Order management does not filter by payment status, the UI looks nice tho

7. Food management UI is broken. (see ref)
