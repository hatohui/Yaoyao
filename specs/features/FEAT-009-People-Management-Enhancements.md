## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] **Capacity Validation**: Visual warning when people count > table capacity
- [ ] **Bulk Import**: CSV upload with format: name, tableId (or table name)
- [ ] **Search**: Search across all people by name (returns table assignment)
- [ ] **Filter**: Filter people list by table
- [ ] **Move Person**: Transfer person from one table to another
- [ ] **Export**: Export people list to CSV or Excel
- [ ] **Capacity Display**: Show "X/Y" format (e.g., "6/4" with warning for over capacity)

## Data Model

```prisma
model People {
  id        String   @id @default(uuid())
  by        String   // Person's name
  tableId   String

  table     Table    @relation(fields: [tableId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)

  createdAt DateTime @default(now())

  @@index([tableId])
}
```

**Note**: Model already exists. No schema changes needed for basic enhancements.

**Optional Enhancement**: Add `position` field for ordering:

```prisma
position  Int?     // For manual ordering within table
```

## Implementation Checklist

  - [ ] `movePerson(personId, newTableId)` - Update tableId
    - [ ] Validate person exists
    - [ ] Validate new table exists
    - [ ] Update record

- [ ] Create API: `pages/api/people/[id]/move.ts`

  - [ ] PUT: Move person to different table

**Note**: If FEAT-005 already covers this, skip standalone CSV export

**üö® CHECKPOINT**: Confirm if standalone export needed or FEAT-005 sufficient

### Phase 7: Enhancement 6 - Reordering (Optional) üìù

- [ ] Add `position` field to People model

  - [ ] Migration: `ALTER TABLE People ADD COLUMN position INT`
  - [ ] Default: order by createdAt

  - [ ] Create table with capacity 4
  - [ ] Add 5 people
  - [ ] Verify warning appears showing "5/4"
  - [ ] Verify warning color/icon visible
  - [ ] Add 6th person - verify still allows but shows warning

- [ ] **Bulk Import Testing**:

  - [ ] Create CSV with 10 people
  - [ ] Upload CSV
  - [ ] Verify all 10 people created
  - [ ] Upload CSV with errors (invalid table) - verify error report
  - [ ] Upload CSV with duplicate names - verify handles correctly

- [ ] **Search Testing**:

  - [ ] Search for "John" - verify finds all Johns across tables
  - [ ] Search with partial name "Jo" - verify fuzzy search works
  - [ ] Search non-existent name - verify shows "No results"
  - [ ] Verify search is case-insensitive

- [ ] **Move Person Testing**:

  - [ ] Move person from Table 1 to Table 2
  - [ ] Verify person appears in Table 2
  - [ ] Verify removed from Table 1
  - [ ] Move to table over capacity - verify warning shown
  - [ ] Confirm move - verify succeeds

- [ ] **Export Testing**:

  - [ ] Export people list
  - [ ] Open CSV file
  - [ ] Verify all people present with correct table assignments
  - [ ] Verify columns correct (name, table, capacity)

- [ ] **Permissions Testing**:
  - [ ] Yaoyao can do all operations
  - [ ] Table leaders cannot bulk import, search globally, or move people
  - [ ] Guests read-only

**üö® CHECKPOINT**: After testing, report results and issues

### Phase 9: Documentation üìù

- [ ] Update this feature file with completion notes
- [ ] Document CSV import format
- [ ] Document capacity warning behavior
- [ ] Note any limitations

## Technical Notes

### Capacity Warning Logic

```typescript
// Reference: Check existing capacity logic
const isOverCapacity = people.length > table.capacity;
const occupancyText = `${people.length}/${table.capacity}`;
const warningColor = isOverCapacity ? "text-red-500" : "text-green-500";
```

### CSV Parsing

**Library Options**:

- **PapaParse**: Popular CSV parser for JavaScript
- **csv-parse**: Node.js CSV parser

**Installation**: `npm install papaparse` (if needed)

**Example Pattern**:

```typescript
import Papa from "papaparse";

const parsed = Papa.parse(csvContent, {
  header: true,
  skipEmptyLines: true,
});
```

### Bulk Create Performance

- Use Prisma `createMany()` for efficiency
- For 100+ people, use batching (50 at a time)
- Wrap in transaction for atomicity

### Search Performance

- Add database index on `People.by` field for faster search
- Use `contains` query with case-insensitive mode

```typescript
// Reference: Check Prisma query patterns
const people = await prisma.people.findMany({
  where: {
    by: {
      contains: query,
      mode: "insensitive",
    },
  },
  include: { table: true },
});
```

## QA Testing Steps

### Test: Capacity Warning

1. Create table "Family" with capacity 4
2. Add 4 people - verify shows "4/4" (green or neutral)
3. Add 5th person - verify shows "5/4" (red/orange with warning icon)
4. Hover warning icon - verify tooltip explains over capacity

### Test: Bulk Import CSV

1. Create CSV file with format: name, tableName
2. Add 10 people to various tables
3. Navigate to people dashboard (Yaoyao)
4. Click "Import from CSV"
5. Upload file
6. Verify success message: "10 people imported"
7. Check tables - verify all people added correctly

### Test: CSV with Errors

1. Create CSV with invalid table name
2. Upload
3. Verify error report shows: "Table 'InvalidTable' not found for John Doe"
4. Verify valid rows still imported, invalid rows skipped

### Test: Search People

1. Add people with names: John Doe, Jane Doe, Alice Smith
2. In search bar, type "Doe"
3. Verify dropdown shows: John Doe (Family), Jane Doe (Family)
4. Click on John Doe - verify navigates to Family table

### Test: Move Person

1. John Doe is in Table "Family"
2. Click "Move" next to John Doe
3. Select new table: "Friends"
4. Verify warning if Friends over capacity
5. Confirm move
6. Verify John Doe now in Friends table
7. Verify removed from Family table

### Test: Export People

1. Click "Export People" button
2. Verify CSV file downloads
3. Open file
4. Verify columns: name, table, capacity
5. Verify all people present

## Edge Cases & Limitations

- [ ] **Capacity Enforcement**: System warns but doesn't block adding people over capacity (by design)
- [ ] **CSV Duplicates**: Same name can be added multiple times (no uniqueness constraint)
- [ ] **Bulk Import Size**: Very large CSV (1000+ rows) may timeout or be slow
- [ ] **Search Performance**: Search across 1000+ people may be slow without proper indexing

## Known Risks

- ‚ö†Ô∏è **CSV Format Errors**: Users may upload incorrectly formatted CSV causing errors
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Over Capacity**: Without hard limit, tables can become unrealistically large
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Data Loss**: Moving person between tables is immediate (no undo)

## Success Metrics

- [ ] Capacity warnings reduce over-capacity tables
- [ ] Bulk import saves time for large events
- [ ] Search helps quickly locate guests
- [ ] Move person feature used for table adjustments

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] **Contact Information**: Add email/phone fields to People model
- [ ] **Dietary Restrictions**: Add notes field for allergies, preferences
- [ ] **Check-In Status**: Track who has arrived at event
- [ ] **Guest Groups**: Link related people (e.g., family members)
- [ ] **Seating Preferences**: Note who wants to sit together
- [ ] **RSVP Status**: Track confirmed vs pending guests

## Notes

- Focus on high-impact enhancements first (capacity warning, bulk import)
- Defer low-priority features (reordering) to future versions
- Leverage existing FEAT-005 export rather than building separate export
- Keep UI simple and intuitive - don't overwhelm users with too many options
